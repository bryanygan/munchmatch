## Name
MunchMatch

## Description
MunchMatch is a Tinder-style food recommendation platform that will curate a personal food option based on your preferences. The program will find and match your perfect dish as you swipe left or right on each option. Preferences like spice tolerance and allergies are taken into account, and dishes that disagree with your preferences will be filtered out automatically.

## Installation
No installation will be needed. Once the site is finalized, we will host it on the web.

## Tech Stack
To develop the site, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
